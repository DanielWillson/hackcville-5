							<p>Each program has their own initial Typeform application that you can access and fill out from their individual websites. The application will ask basic questions (i.e. year, major, etc.), as well as longer questions to understand why you would like to join the HackCville community. You may apply to no more than two programs (should you be accepted to both, you must choose one).</p>

							<p>After you submit your application, it will be reviewed by current HackCville staff members, all of which are students (with the exception of our two full-time staff members). Staff members blind themselves to all names, emails, and demographic information to minimize any bias. Three staff members will review each application.</p>
