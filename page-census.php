			<h1>2a) Create something new in an HC Project.</h1>
			<p><span style="font-weight:bold">HC Projects are like mini-startups:</span> we give you some guidelines, a business idea we know that works, some guidance, and let you go from there. You'll make something new, learn a ton, and if you do awesome you can even make some money. They're fun, intense, and rewarding ways to practice making an early-stage organization work. <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: light;">(Working on your own project? <a href="#alpha">Jump to the next section.</a>)</span></p>
			<p>We had two HC Projects this past spring: Trips + Pioneer. We have many more we're launching this Fall:</p>

			<h1>2b) Work on your own Project in Alpha.</h1>
			<p>Regardless of what stage you're at, we can help you take the next step forward with your side project, startup, non-profit, or student organization. Even if you just have an inkling of an idea (but no progress yet) we can help you get started and move forward. In the Census we'll ask for a little bit of information about where you're progress so far so we can better understand how we can help.</p>
			<p>In Alpha, you'll join a tight-knit group of members all working to make new things. You'll check in with that group each week so you can push each other to make progress. You'll also receive regular mentorship from our full-time staff and our Elliewood Fellows.</p>

			<h1>3) Learn a skill in a Program.</h1>
			<p>These are a similar commitment to this semester with a few tweaks. You'll meet twice a week:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">One meeting is with all 15 people in your program</span> for 2 hours. (The format for this is the same as it is right now.) Here are the program times for the Fall:
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://hackcville.com/program/convert" target="_blank">Convert</a> (marketing): To be announced this summer. You can still sign up now, though.</li>
						<li><a href="https://hackcville.com/program/vector" target="_blank">Vector</a> (graphic design): To be announced this summer. You can still sign up now, though.</li>
						<li><a href="https://hackcville.com/program/the-node" target="_blank">Node</a> (data science): Sundays 1:30-3:30pm</li>
						<li><a href="https://hackcville.com/program/wireframe" target="_blank">Wireframe</a> (web design): Wednesdays at 7:30-9:30pm</li>
						<li><a href="https://hackcville.com/program/exposure" target="_blank">Exposure</a> (photography): Fridays 2-4pm</li>
						<li><a href="https://hackcville.com/program/storyboard" target="_blank">Storyboard</a> (video): Sundays 11am-1pm</li>
						<li><a href="https://hackcville.com/program/source" target="_blank">Source</a> (software dev): Tuesdays 5-7pm</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">The other meeting each week</span> is in a small group of 3-5 people to work on what you're learning in your program. The time for this meeting is more flexible, and can change if needed week-to-week. This is to give you more flexibility in your schedule and to enable you to get to know more members more closely.</li>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">On the Census, please only sign up for a Program if you're very confident you can make the meeting times listed above.</span> We know schedules change and we can accommodate if needed, but try to stick to what you know you can make.</p>
			<p>You do not need to re-apply. However, if interest exceeds space then we may have to move to a lottery system for existing members. We've never had to do this before, but it is a possibility.</p>
			<p>Essentials is not available to existing members in Fall 2018 as we test it out with new applicants first. Hustle, Ignite, and Spark are all "on pause" as their Program teams work together to launch the Essentials program.</p>

			<h1>4) Build on your skills in a competition.</h1>
			<p>These are a great "step 2" after completing a program.</p>
			<p>We've compiled <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sKuSj2NgLfq42ST-_xWtM8uaIoJsT_kRYPeOz9zWrZU/edit" target="_blank">a long list of skills competitions</a> held locally and across the country. We'll help you form teams with other HackCvillers to apply to these competitions. These will push you to practice and improve your skills with the potential for big prizes. Our staff will coach and support you as you work toward these.</p>
			<p>All you'll need to do on the Census is pick one of these topics:
				<ul>
					<li>Web Design</li>
					<li>Graphic Design</li>
					<li>Photography</li>
					<li>Video</li>
					<li>Software</li>
					<li>Data</li>
					<li>Marketing</li>

				...and we'll help you form team(s) in the fall to apply to one or many of the skills competitions we know about. (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sKuSj2NgLfq42ST-_xWtM8uaIoJsT_kRYPeOz9zWrZU/edit" target="_blank">Here's our working list</a> that we're adding to all of the time.)

			<p>These dues can be waived (via the Census) to anyone with financial need, no questions asked. We ask that you do not abuse this policy - dues are a vital form of income for us.</p>

			<p>However, we do make exceptions. If you're very confident you could give the time and dedication needed to participate in multiple opportunities, get in touch with us (hello@hackcville.com) and let us know why. </p>
