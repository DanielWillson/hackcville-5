We were blown away by the quality of their work and how quickly thye began contributing to the team.<br><br>They added tremendous bandwidth to what we could accomplish as a small startup and were able to keep them on for part-time stints while back at school. We even tried to convince one of them to leave school and work with us full-time."</p>

				<h1>How Trips Work</h1>
				<div class="flex">
					<div class="flex-1-of-2 steps">
						<h2><i>1. Apply</i></h2>
						<p>Anyone 18+ can apply to our trips through our quick online application. (We give extra consideration to existing HackCville members, but not guaranteed admission.) You can see our upcoming trips below - applications typically open about 30-45 days before the trip. <br><br>You don't need to be looking for an internship or job to apply - these trips are a great opportunity to just get inspired and learn about the opportunities available to you.</p>

						<img src="images/nyc6.jpg">
					</div>
					<div class="flex-1-of-2 step-2">
						<h2><i>2. Career Prep</i></h2>
						<p>Accepted students will get access to exclusive workshops where we'll help you tweak your resume, LinkedIn, and share tips and tricks for effective networking. Students will submit their final resumes in advance of the trip to be sent to our hiring company partners.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="flex-1-of-2 step-2">
						<h2><i>3. Company Visits</i></h2>
						<p>On a typical trip, we'll visit 5-6 for about an hour each. We usually speak to fairly high-level employees - founders, CTOs, marketing directors, ect - about their experiences. HackCville and/or UVA alumni employees at these companies are frequent hosts of these visits.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="flex-1-of-2 step-2">
						<h2><i>4. Alumni Mixer</i></h2>
						<p>We end each day of visits with an opportunity to network with dozens of local alumni in whatever city we're visiting. You'll get to talk to them about how they got to where they are today. Many are hiring, too! Most students walk away with new friends and new contacts that can help them with their personal projects, academic journey, and job prospects.</p>

				<p>Our startup trips have been proven to be transformative experiences that dramatically expand the opportunities and networks of attendees. Because of this, our goal is to make these trips as accessible as possible. <br><br>Our supportive sponsors above enable us to subsidize the cost of all our trips, sometimes by as much as 50%. Partial and full scholarships are available to students with financial need. Applications are reviewed need-blind.</p>
