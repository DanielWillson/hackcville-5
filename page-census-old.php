					<h1>How to stay involved at HC this Spring</h1>
					<h3>Learn about your 5 options for continuing to learn, build, start, and lead</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-3-of-5">
					<p>After your first semester at HackCville, there are a lot of different ways you can continue to stay involved:
						<ol>
							<li>Leadership</li>
							<li>Team Challenges (new!)</li>
							<li>Program</li>
							<li>Project/Startup</li>
							<li>Partner Organization</li>
							<li>Go Abroad or Go Inactive</li>
						</ol>
					These are all outlined in detail below! Once you're ready to pick and your questions are answered, you submit the <span style="font-weight: bold;">HackCville Census</span>, which enrolls you in the option you've selected. (This is kind of like our hopefully-less-shitty version of SIS.)</p>
					<p>The Census needs to be completed by 11:59pm on Monday, November 27 (right after Thanksgiving). It is mandatory for all members, even if you're picking option 6 above.</p>

			<p>Applications for this were due on Sunday, November 11. If you’re super-interested and you forgot, we have quietly extended the deadline through Monday, November 12. Details are <a href="http://hackcville.com/leadership" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			<p>Even if you've been accepted into leadership or you're on staff, you still need to fill out the Census. There will be an option to signify that you're already part of Leadership.</p>

					<h2>2) TEAM CHALLENGES</h2>
					<p style="font-style: italic;">A new, flexible, member-only way to learn new skills while building toward a fun end-of-semester challenge</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-1-of-2">
					<h2>3) PROGRAMS</h2>
					<p style="font-style: italic;">Our traditional program structure to introduce anyone to the basics of a technical or entrepreneurial skill</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-1-of-2">
					<h4>Who challenges are for:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>You’re a self-motivated learner, or want to become one</li>
						<li>You're ready for a new experience after taking a HackCville program</li>
						<li>You have a strong curiosity around a particular topic, even if you’re a complete newbie</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-1-of-2">
					<h4>Who programs are for:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>You learn best with lots of structure and support</li>
						<li>You’re completely new to a topic</li>
						<li>You want to explore a topic to see if it’s something you really enjoy</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-1-of-2">
					<h4>Challenge topic options:</h4>
					<p>You'll pick one or more of these on the Census: videography, photography, web design, software dev, graphic design, data science.</p>
					<p>You can use Challenges to get started in a topic or use them to advance your existing skills. You can also suggest a new topic, like beer or cryptocurrency.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-1-of-2">
					<h4>Program topic options:</h4>
					<p>Meeting times and options for spring programs are available at <a href="http://hackcville.com/programs" target="_blank">hackcville.com/programs</a>. We have two new programs next semester: marketing and sales. (Fun names TBD.)</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-1-of-2">
					<h4>How challenges work:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>You tell us which topic(s) you’re interested in on the Census</li>
						<li>We place you into a team of 4-5 other members. You can request to be put in a team with friends. You work with that team each week to teach each other what you want to learn.</li>
						<li>We give you a HackCville coach who will give you some initial structure, guidance, and resources to learn.</li> 
						<li>We work with you to decide on a big challenge for the end of the semester to demonstrate what you've learned. These are different depending on the topic. (Make a cryptocurrency trading bot, brew your own beer, redesign an app, etc.)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We expect about 100-120 existing members to participate in challenges.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-1-of-2">
					<h4>How programs work:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>You tell us which program you want to take. You must be available at the regular meeting times, listed below.</li>
						<li>You’ll have a brief interview in January to ensure that you’re a great fit for the program. Depending on how this goes, we may recommend another method of involvement next semester, or that you join a team challenge instead.</li>
						<li>You meet twice each week at the regular times for the semester.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We expect about 30-50 existing members to participate in programs.</p>
