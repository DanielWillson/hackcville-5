			<h1>How Startup Trips Work</h1>
			<div class="flex">
				<div class="flex-1-of-2">
					<h2>1. Apply</h2>
					<p>Anyone 18+ can apply to our trips through our quick online application. (We give extra consideration to existing HackCville members, but not guaranteed admission.) You can see our upcoming trips below - applications typically open about 30-45 days before the trip. <br><br>You don't need to be looking for an internship or job to apply - these trips are a great opportunity to just get inspired and learn about the opportunities available to you.</p>

					<h2>2. Career Prep</h2>
					<p>Accepted students will get access to exclusive workshops where we'll help you tweak your resume, LinkedIn, and share tips and tricks for effective networking. Students will submit their final resumes in advance of the trip to be sent to our hiring company partners.</p>

					<h2>3. Company Visits</h2>
					<p>On a typical trip, we'll visit 5-6 companies for about an hour each. We often speak to high-level employees - founders, CTOs, marketing directors, etc - about their experiences. HackCville and/or UVA alumni employees at these companies are frequent hosts of these visits.</p>

					<h2>4. Alumni Mixer</h2>
					<p>We end each day of visits with an opportunity to network with dozens of local alumni in whatever city we're visiting. You'll get to talk to them about how they got to where they are today. Many are hiring, too! Most students walk away with new friends and new contacts that can help them with their personal projects, academic journey, and job prospects.</p>
