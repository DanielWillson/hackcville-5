He was offered the teaching role after his excellent work in our 6-week summer data science intensive.</p>
                            <p>He's incredibly personable and has the communication skills of someone far beyond his age and experience. It wasn't a surprise to our team that 0 students dropped his class last fall. (That's the only time that's ever happened out of all 13 classes we offer.)</p>

She was tasked with understanding and improving their e-commerce sales using her new data science skills. Gaby brings an energy and enthusiasm to everything she does, so we also weren't surprised when Lumi decided to keep her on part-time this fall.</p>
                            <p>Gaby also has completed our web design fundamentals and introduction to entrepreneurship courses at HackCville.</p>

                            <p>Uzair (Uzi) Minhas is a 2014 UVA graduate. At UVA, he studied finance at the McIntire School of Commerce. He was also president of the entrepreneurship club where he helped start the same Startup Trips that brought our students to Plated this November. After graduation, he worked at PwC as a Senior Associate for 3 years.</p>
                            <p>Uzi left his job in September to shift toward working in software engineering. He simultaneously enrolled in George Mason University's CS program and traveled to Charlottesville each week to take our software engineering course. There he learned Node and React. When he wants to learn something, he throws himself into it.</p> 
                            <p>Many members of our leadership have known or worked with Uzi for years. His work ethic and enthusiasm are unmatched and raise the energy level of any team he works with.</p>

                            <p>Harun's fast to pick up skills and clearly enjoys mentoring others as well. As a first year, he's light on work experience -- but his experience in software projects is longer than many of our 4th years.</p>
