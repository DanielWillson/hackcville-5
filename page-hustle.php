					<h3>Work on 4 fun, mini-startup projects.</h3>
					<p>The Hustle program is built around 4 mini-startup projects. You'll work on a new one every 2-3 weeks in a small team. You don't have to come with an idea -- we'll give you dozens of curated, detailed, and guided projects for you to pick from. Launch a class, run a concert, redesign an app, etc...the choice is yours.</p>
					<p>We host workshops each week to train you on the technical and entrepreneurial skills you need to succeed. Then you'll get out into the world and make these projects happen.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-1-of-2">
					<h3>Learn to start new ideas like a startup expert.</h3>
					<p>The early stages of any problem can be ambiguous and scary. We’ll teach you how to use <span class="em">hacks</span> and <span class="em">smartcuts</span> to solve tough problems and launch new ideas. </p>
					<p>You’ll learn how to launch a website without any code, design a brand without Photoshop, and network into your dream internship or job without a career fair. Along the way you’ll gain confidence in your ability to tackle any ambiguous problem, whether it’s designing your major or starting a business. And you'll gain clarity into what you want to continue learning, way faster than you ever could in school.</p>

					<h3>Join Charlottesville’s community of 400+ self-starters. </h3>
